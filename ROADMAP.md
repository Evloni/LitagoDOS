## Current Progress
- Successfully implemented GRUB multiboot bootloader with correct header configuration
- Set up basic kernel structure with modular design
- Implemented VGA text mode driver with:
  - Text output
  - Color support
  - Cursor control
  - Newline handling
  - Debug output system
- Organized code into separate modules (kernel, VGA, drivers)
- Implemented basic driver system with registration and initialization
- Added GDT and IDT initialization
- Set up keyboard driver registration
- Implemented proper memory initialization sequence
- Added debug output system for development

## Next Steps
1. Complete keyboard driver implementation and input handling
2. Implement basic memory management
3. Create simple command parser
4. Add basic file system support
5. Implement timer driver for system timing

## Development Guidelines
1. Start with the simplest working version and iterate
2. Test each component thoroughly before moving to the next phase
3. Keep the code modular and well-documented
4. Use version control (Git) from the beginning
5. Regular backups of development environment
6. Maintain clean and minimal output for production builds

## Tools and Technologies
- Assembly (NASM) for bootloader and low-level code
- C for kernel and higher-level components
- QEMU for testing and debugging
- Git for version control
- Make for build automation

## Getting Started
1. Set up development environment
2. Create basic bootloader
3. Implement kernel entry point
4. Add basic terminal output
5. Implement keyboard input
6. Create basic shell
