## Development Guidelines
1. Start with the simplest working version and iterate
2. Test each component thoroughly before moving to the next phase
3. Keep the code modular and well-documented
4. Use version control (Git) from the beginning
5. Regular backups of development environment

## Tools and Technologies
- Assembly (NASM) for bootloader and low-level code
- C for kernel and higher-level components
- QEMU for testing and debugging
- Git for version control
- Make for build automation

## Getting Started
1. Set up development environment
2. Create basic bootloader
3. Implement kernel entry point
4. Add basic terminal output
5. Implement keyboard input
6. Create basic shell
