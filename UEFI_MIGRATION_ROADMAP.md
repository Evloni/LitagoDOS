# UEFI Modernization Roadmap for LitagoDOS - Hybrid Approach

## Overview
This roadmap outlines a **hybrid modernization approach** for LitagoDOS, transitioning from BIOS-based 32-bit to UEFI-based 64-bit architecture while systematically preserving and enhancing the existing sophisticated features. This approach balances modernization with feature preservation.

## Strategic Approach: Hybrid Modernization

### Why Hybrid Instead of Pure Migration or Rewrite
- **Preserve Investment**: Your sophisticated features (GUI, shell, filesystem, editor) are production-quality
- **Modern Foundation**: Get UEFI + 64-bit benefits without losing functionality

- **Learning Opportunity**: Understand both legacy and modern architectures

### Current Architecture Strengths to Preserve
- **Advanced GUI System**: VBE graphics, custom fonts, box drawing, ANSI support
- **Sophisticated Shell**: Tab completion, command history, file operations
- **Rich Filesystem**: FAT16, ISO9660 with full CRUD operations
- **Text Editor**: Full-featured editor with file operations
- **Memory Management**: PMM, heap, memory mapping with testing
- **Device Drivers**: Modular driver architecture with abstraction layers
- **User Experience**: Boot animations, progress indicators, professional polish
